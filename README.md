# Git Commit Message Rule
After performing the **`git add .`** command, the **`git commit`** message should follow this structure:

    git commit -m "[folder/file updated] - [task description]"

**Example:**
    
    git commit -m "Programs/linear_programming_solver.c - solving linear programming problems"

Task description should provide enough information for other members to understand what was updated or changed, e.g., fixing bugs, adding features, refactoring code.

After that, use the **`git push`** command to push into the GitHub repository.

# Introduce
Linear programming (LP), also called linear optimization, is a method to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a mathematical model whose requirements and objective are represented by linear relationships. 

The process for solving the linear programming problem includes the following steps:

    Standardizing the Problem: Transforming the problem into its standard form.
    Automated Method Selection: Automatically selecting the most suitable method (e.g., Simplex Method, Bland's Method, Two-Phase Simplex Method).
    Problem Solving: Solving the problem using the chosen method.
    Output Steps and Results: Providing the pivoting steps (optional) and the final solution to the problem.
